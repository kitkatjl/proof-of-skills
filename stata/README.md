This a small assignment that portrays the basic knowledge of Stata, mostly as a tool for data cleansing.
Final assignment of Daria Yermolova for the course of 'Coding for economists'. The project estimates the effect of GDP per capita on life expectancy. The data is taken from https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/#billion-prices .
The assumed equation is quadratic. 
To replicate, download the raw_data.csv file to the same folder as the data_editing.do file and execute the do file in Stata. You have to gain a graph in pdf, a regression table as doc and clean_data.dta. The Python code is independent of the rest.
